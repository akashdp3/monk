# Monk - Your Documentation Evolution Manager

## Overview

Monk is a modern documentation management system designed to make documentation a natural part of your workflow. It solves the common problems of documentation becoming outdated, hard to find, and disconnected from actual work.

## Why Monk?

Traditional documentation tools often fail because they:

- Make documentation feel like a separate burden
- Don't adapt to changing information
- Make it difficult to find relevant information
- Lack proper organization and structure

Monk addresses these challenges by providing:

- Quick capture capabilities
- Smart organization
- Version timeline tracking
- Powerful search and discovery

## Core Features

### üöÄ Quick Capture

- Global keyboard shortcuts for instant documentation
- Markdown editor with live preview
- Custom templates for different documentation types
- Floating capture button for quick access

### üìö Smart Organization

- Automatic categorization based on content
- Intuitive tag system
- Wiki-style document linking
- Dynamic folder structure

### ‚è±Ô∏è Version Timeline

- Track document evolution
- Change history with context
- Outdated content detection
- Update suggestions

### üîç Search & Discovery

- Full-text search capabilities
- Tag and category filtering
- Related document suggestions
- Quick access to recent docs

### üîÑ Git Integration & Smart Documentation

- **Automatic Git Change Documentation**

  - Captures commit messages and associated context
  - Links code changes to documentation automatically
  - Maintains a searchable history of why changes were made
  - Creates documentation drafts from significant commits

- **Interactive Development Prompts**

  - Smart prompts for documenting critical changes
  - Customizable question templates based on change types
  - Automated reminders for documentation updates
  - Contextual questions based on code patterns

- **Change Impact Analysis**

  - Identifies which documentation needs updates based on code changes
  - Tracks dependencies between code and documentation
  - Suggests documentation updates when related code changes
  - Maintains traceability between code and documentation

- **Developer Collaboration**
  - Prompts reviewers with relevant questions during code reviews
  - Captures discussion context from pull requests
  - Integrates with issue tracking systems
  - Maintains a knowledge graph of code-doc relationships

## How Git Integration Works

### Automatic Documentation

```bash
# Example: When making a commit
git commit -m "Update user authentication flow"
# Monk automatically:
# 1. Analyzes the changes
# 2. Prompts relevant questions
# 3. Updates related documentation
# 4. Links the changes to existing docs
```

### Smart Prompts

Monk intelligently asks questions based on change patterns:

- **For API Changes:**

  - "How does this affect the API contract?"
  - "Are there any backward compatibility concerns?"

- **For Database Changes:**

  - "What data migration steps are needed?"
  - "How does this affect existing queries?"

- **For UI Changes:**
  - "What user workflows are impacted?"
  - "Are there any accessibility considerations?"

### Integration Flow

1. Developer makes code changes
2. Monk analyzes the git diff
3. Relevant documentation is identified
4. Smart prompts are triggered
5. Documentation is updated automatically
6. Changes are linked and indexed
